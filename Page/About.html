    <p class="text">
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our solution is to provide exercise books for high school grader with the provided solution using explaining video, instead of raw solution written on actual books. In the book, customers are allowed to find a solution by scanning the QR code of that specific exercise that leads them to our app/website. Our innovation combines traditional paper-based learning with digital technology. This promotes the use of digital technology in education, which is becoming increasingly important in today's world.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though this innovation has been adopted by Western and some Asian countries, this is new to Cambodia. Furthermore, we will make some changes in some parts to not only be beneficial for students, but also educators alike.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to SDGs 4(Quality Education), 9(Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and 10(Reduced Inequalities). Our innovation involves solving problems by providing additional resources and promoting the use of digital technology in education, combining traditional paper-based learning with digital technology, and by providing a cost-effective solution for schools and students who may not have access to expensive digital devices or internet connectivity.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This solution gives student benefit in saving time, improve self-study, personalized their learning opportunity, enhance their learning experience, support different types of learners, easier to carry on, and especially they can improve their family economy by reducing the cost on private tutoring and keep student engaging in learning more than doing exercise on existing traditional books. This promotes self study to be more effective and especially for those families with lower income that are not able to go to private tutoring save a lot of money.

            <h2 class="title">Vision and mission statement</h2>
    <ul class="text">
        <br>
        <li><b>- Vision</b> :  Our vision is to revolutionize high school education by providing a comprehensive learning platform that empowers students to achieve their academic goals through interactive and engaging video solutions.
        </li>
        <li><b>- Mission statement</b>:  Our mission is to enhance the learning experiences for all learners especially for high school students by providing easy access to video solutions for each exercise in our exercise books. We aim to create a collaborative learning community where students can upload their own exercises, receive responses from senior students or teachers. Improving self-study is the significance of developing the quality of students in Cambodia.
        </li>
        <li><b>- Goals</b>: Our goal is to increase the graduation rate of high school students. We aim to achieve this by continuously improving our app and website with schools to integrate our platform into their curriculum. Ultimately, we want to empower students to not only graduate but also pursue higher education and career opportunities with confidence and success and also promote Cambodia economic growth.

            <h2 class="title">Future Plan</h2>
    <p class="text">
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we will mainly focus on highschool grader (10-12), since this grade does involve more complex exercises with deeper solution, understanding, and explanation for the exercises. Furthermore, students in this age group require more self-study in order to prepare well for general and national exam (bacll). If this proposed solution is successful, we will expand our domain size to be bigger, from 10-12 grader to 7-12 grader, to even globalize for all nations.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for video content makers. One of our team members has experience in part-time teaching for 6 months. Besides that, some other members also are in the digital field that can collaborate to develop this project with high opportunity. So with these experiences, we are able to be independent and create videos by ourselves explaining the exercise solution part. We also intend to get help from other university students who are majoring in becoming a teacher. By doing so, we are building a university student association for teachers-to-be (allow them to gain experience, make some profit, and build their fame before entering the actual working field). We also welcome teachers who have passion in helping students with their study, and help them gain some extra profit by becoming a part of our project in helping the community.
